  PLEASE NOTE: This project is not recommended on recent versions of Windows
  and many applications written for Windows Vista and later require features
  that are not supported. It is based on an old design for compatibility with
  as old versions as Windows NT 3.51. No new features will be added to this
  project but it will remain available here because it could still be useful in
  certain scenarios.

  I will continue development of Arsenal Image Mounter instead. That has a
  different design and emulates complete disks and is compatible with most
  cases where physical disk are normally used.

  Back to this project, ImDisk Virtual Disk driver.
  This driver emulates harddisk partitions, floppy drives and CD/DVD-ROM drives
  from disk image files, in virtual memory or by redirecting I/O requests
  somewhere else, possibly to another machine, through a co-operating user-mode
  service, ImDskSvc.

  To install this driver, service and command line tool, right-click on the
  imdisk.inf file and select 'Install'. To uninstall, use the Add/Remove
  Programs applet in the Control Panel.

  You can get syntax help to the command line tool by typing just imdisk
  without parameters.

  I have tested this product under 32-bit versions of Windows NT 3.51, NT 4.0,
  2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 and x86-64 versions of XP,
  Server 2003, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Primary target are older versions and
  there are several known compatibility issues on modern version of Windows.
  Please see website for more details: https://ltr-data.se/opencode.html#ImDisk

  The install/uninstall routines do not work under NT 3.51. If you want to use
  this product under NT 3.51 you have to manually add registry entries needed
  by driver and service or use resource kit tools to add necessary settings.
  
  To install/uninstall on ARM or ARM64 architectures a manual setup is needed.
